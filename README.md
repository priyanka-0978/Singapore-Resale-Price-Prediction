# Singapore-Resale-Price-Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

### WorkFlow of Project:

1) Collecting a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the 
   years 1990 to Till Date. 

2) Data Preprocessing:

   Overcoming Null values
      
   Removing Noise data/Feature
  
   Encoding the Categorical Columns using ordinal and one hot encoding
  
   Handling skewness
      
   All these process are done in Preprocessing of data and analysed.

3) Exploratory data Analysis:

   The relationship between Resale Price and specific Features are analysed by plotting correlation.

4) Model Building
  
5) Evaluating Model 

6) Saved the best fitted model using pickling

7) Developing Streamlit Web Application

8) Deploying the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it accessible to users over the internet.
